KMActf is a Capture The Flag framework focusing on ease of use and customizability.

KMActf comes with most of the features needed by an event organizer to run a competition or workshop. In addition, if KMActf's feature set is insufficient, KMActf allows for the usage of plugins and themes to control almost every aspect of how it looks and behaves.

KMActf is used by many different clubs, universities, and companies to host their own Capture The Flags.

While available as open source, KMActf developers also provide a managed hosting service available at https://ctfd.io/.

KMActf is written in Python and makes use of the Flask web framework.
